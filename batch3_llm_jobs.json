This allows us to apply formatting fixes and dependency updates directly, significantly speeding up the review and approval process.\n\nTo enable write access on your PR from Airbyte maintainers, please check the \"Allow edits from maintainers\" box when submitting from your PR. You must also create your PR from a fork in your **personal GitHub account** rather than an organization account, or else you will not see this option. The requirement to create from your personal fork is based on GitHub's additional security restrictions for PRs created from organization forks. For more information about the GitHub security model, please see the [GitHub documentation page regarding PRs from forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).\n\nFor more details on contribution requirements, please see our [contribution workflow documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/contributing-to-airbyte#standard-contribution-workflow).\n\n### Security\n\nAirbyte takes security issues very seriously. **Please do not file GitHub issues or post on our public forum for security vulnerabilities**. Email `security@airbyte.io` if you believe you have uncovered a vulnerability. In the message, try to provide a description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. The security team will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n[Airbyte Enterprise](https://airbyte.com/airbyte-enterprise) also offers additional security features (among others) on top of Airbyte open-source.\n\n### License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](docs/LICENSE) file for licensing information, and our [FAQ](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/developer-guides/licenses/license-faq) for any questions you may have on that topic.\n\n### Thank You\n\nAirbyte would not be possible without the support and assistance of other open-source tools and companies!

Therefore, development and maintenance has been discontinued, it is time to go for the native `crypto` module.\n\n## Node.js (Install)\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Node.js\n- npm (Node.js package manager)\n\n```bash\nnpm install crypto-js\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nES6 import for typical API call signing use case:\n\n```javascript\nimport sha256 from 'crypto-js/sha256';\nimport hmacSHA512 from 'crypto-js/hmac-sha512';\nimport Base64 from 'crypto-js/enc-base64';\n\nconst message, nonce, path, privateKey; // ...\nconst hashDigest = sha256(nonce + message);\nconst hmacDigest = Base64.stringify(hmacSHA512(path + hashDigest, privateKey));\n```\n\nModular include:\n\n```javascript\nvar AES = require(\"crypto-js/aes\");\nvar SHA256 = require(\"crypto-js/sha256\");\n...\nconsole.log(SHA256(\"Message\"));\n```\n\nIncluding all libraries, for access to extra methods:\n\n```javascript\nvar CryptoJS = require(\"crypto-js\");\nconsole.log(CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(\"Message\", \"Key\"));\n```\n\n## Client (browser)\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Node.js\n- Bower (package manager for frontend)\n\n```bash\nbower install crypto-js\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nModular include:\n\n```javascript\nrequire.config({\n    packages: [\n        {\n            name: 'crypto-js',\n            location: 'path-to/bower_components/crypto-js',\n            main: 'index'\n        }\n    ]\n});\n\nrequire([\"crypto-js/aes\", \"crypto-js/sha256\"], function (AES, SHA256) {\n    console.log(SHA256(\"Message\"));\n});\n```\n\nIncluding all libraries, for access to extra methods:\n\n```javascript\n// Above-mentioned will work or use this simple form\nrequire.config({\n    paths: {\n        'crypto-js': 'path-to/bower_components/crypto-js/crypto-js'\n    }\n});\n\nrequire([\"crypto-js\"], function (CryptoJS) {\n    console.log(CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(\"Message\", \"Key\"));\n});\n```\n\n### Usage without RequireJS\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path-to/bower_components/crypto-js/crypto-js.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES(...);\n    var encrypted = CryptoJS.SHA256(...);\n</script>\n```\n\n## API\n\nSee: https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/\n\n### AES Encryption\n\n#### Plain text encryption\n\n```javascript\nvar CryptoJS = require(\"crypto-js\");\n\n// Encrypt\nvar ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('my message', 'secret key 123').toString();\n\n// Decrypt\nvar bytes  = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext, 'secret key 123');\nvar originalText = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);\n\nconsole.log(originalText); // 'my message'\n```\n\n#### Object encryption\n\n```javascript\nvar CryptoJS = require(\"crypto-js\");\n\nvar data = [{id: 1}, {id: 2}]\n\n// Encrypt\nvar ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(data), 'secret key 123').toString();\n\n// Decrypt\nvar bytes  = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext, 'secret key 123');\nvar decryptedData = JSON.parse(bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));\n\nconsole.log(decryptedData); // [{id: 1}, {id: 2}]\n```\n\n### List of modules\n\n\n- ```crypto-js/core```\n- ```crypto-js/x64-core```\n- ```crypto-js/lib-typedarrays```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/md5```\n- ```crypto-js/sha1```\n- ```crypto-js/sha256```\n- ```crypto-js/sha224```\n- ```crypto-js/sha512```\n- ```crypto-js/sha384```\n- ```crypto-js/sha3```\n- ```crypto-js/ripemd160```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-md5```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-sha1```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-sha256```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-sha224```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-sha512```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-sha384```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-sha3```\n- ```crypto-js/hmac-ripemd160```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/pbkdf2```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/aes```\n- ```crypto-js/tripledes```\n- ```crypto-js/rc4```\n- ```crypto-js/rabbit```\n- ```crypto-js/rabbit-legacy```\n- ```crypto-js/evpkdf```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/format-openssl```\n- ```crypto-js/format-hex```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/enc-latin1```\n- ```crypto-js/enc-utf8```\n- ```crypto-js/enc-hex```\n- ```crypto-js/enc-utf16```\n- ```crypto-js/enc-base64```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/mode-cfb```\n- ```crypto-js/mode-ctr```\n- ```crypto-js/mode-ctr-gladman```\n- ```crypto-js/mode-ofb```\n- ```crypto-js/mode-ecb```\n\n---\n\n- ```crypto-js/pad-pkcs7```\n- ```crypto-js/pad-ansix923```\n- ```crypto-js/pad-iso10126```\n- ```crypto-js/pad-iso97971```\n- ```crypto-js/pad-zeropadding```\n- ```crypto-js/pad-nopadding```\n\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 4.2.0\n\nChange default hash algorithm and iteration's for PBKDF2 to prevent weak security by using the default configuration.\n\nCustom KDF Hasher\n\nBlowfish support\n\n### 4.1.1\n\nFix module order in bundled release.\n\nInclude the browser field in the released package.json.\n\n### 4.1.0\n\nAdded url safe variant of base64 encoding.

However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies, and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute with more items provided below.\n\n* If you are targeting legacy JavaScript engine with those ES5 methods, you can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)\n\n* Please note that, the examples used below are just showing you the native alternative of performing certain tasks. For some functions, Lodash provides you more options than native built-ins. This list is not a 1:1 comparison.\n\n* Please send a PR if you want to add or modify the code. No need to open an issue unless it's something big and you want to discuss.\n\n\n## Voice of Developers\n\n> [Make use of native JavaScript object and array utilities before going big.](https://twitter.com/codylindley/status/692356631007342593)\n\n> &mdash;<cite>Cody Lindley, Author of [jQuery Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159788.do) and [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do)</cite>\n\n<!-- -->\n> [You probably don't need Lodash.

However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies, and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute with more items provided below.\n\n* If you are targeting legacy JavaScript engine with those ES5 methods, you can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)\n\n* Please note that, the examples used below are just showing you the native alternative of performing certain tasks.

However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies, and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute with more items provided below.\n\n* If you are targeting legacy JavaScript engine with those ES5 methods, you can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)\n\n* Please note that, the examples used below are just showing you the native alternative of performing certain tasks. For some functions, Lodash provides you more options than native built-ins. This list is not a 1:1 comparison.\n\n* Please send a PR if you want to add or modify the code. No need to open an issue unless it's something big and you want to discuss.\n\n\n## Voice of Developers\n\n> [Make use of native JavaScript object and array utilities before going big.](https://twitter.com/codylindley/status/692356631007342593)\n\n> &mdash;<cite>Cody Lindley, Author of [jQuery Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159788.do) and [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do)</cite>\n\n<!-- -->\n> [You probably don't need Lodash.

However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6].

However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies, and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute with more items provided below.\n\n* If you are targeting legacy JavaScript engine with those ES5 methods, you can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)\n\n* Please note that, the examples used below are just showing you the native alternative of performing certain tasks. For some functions, Lodash provides you more options than native built-ins. This list is not a 1:1 comparison.\n\n* Please send a PR if you want to add or modify the code. No need to open an issue unless it's something big and you want to discuss.\n\n\n## Voice of Developers\n\n> [Make use of native JavaScript object and array utilities before going big.](https://twitter.com/codylindley/status/692356631007342593)\n\n> &mdash;<cite>Cody Lindley, Author of [jQuery Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159788.do) and [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do)</cite>\n\n<!-- -->\n> [You probably don't need Lodash.

However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies, and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute with more items provided below.\n\n* If you are targeting legacy JavaScript engine with those ES5 methods, you can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)\n\n* Please note that, the examples used below are just showing you the native alternative of performing certain tasks. For some functions, Lodash provides you more options than native built-ins. This list is not a 1:1 comparison.\n\n* Please send a PR if you want to add or modify the code.

No markdown fences (```json) or backticks.\n- Installation must contain ONLY executable commands. No prose.\n- Prerequisites and Post-installation may contain text + code (MDX allowed).\n- Extract ANYTHING even remotely related to: installation, setup, environment preparation, dependencies, build,

of how to install or re-install (e.g., \"Install via pip or docker\").\n        b) **Development/Plugin Examples:** Do not include long code blocks, function definitions, or complex prose explaining how to develop plugins or features.\n        c) **Non-Essential Documentation:** Exclude general overviews, feature lists, or community links.\n    - The output must be concise, minimal, and free of

of how to install or re-install (e.g., \"Install via pip or docker\").\n        b) **Development/Plugin Examples:** Do not include long code blocks, function definitions, or complex prose explaining

Built with Tauri 2, it provides a beautiful GUI for managing your Claude Code sessions, creating custom agents, tracking usage, and much more.\n\nThink of opcode as your command center for Claude Code - bridging the gap between the command-line tool and a visual experience that makes AI-assisted development more intuitive and productive.\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Table of Contents\n\n- [\ud83c\udf1f

Install bun\n   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash\n   ```\n\n3. **Git**\n   ```bash\n   # Usually pre-installed, but if not:\n   # Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install git\n   # macOS: brew install git\n   # Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com\n   ```\n\n4. **Claude Code CLI**\n   - Download and install from [Claude's official site](https://claude.ai/code)\n   - Ensure `claude` is available in your PATH\n\n#### Platform-Specific Dependencies\n\n**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**\n```bash\n# Install system dependencies\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y \\\n  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \\\n  libgtk-3-dev \\\n  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \\\n  librsvg2-dev \\\n  patchelf \\\n  build-essential \\\n  curl \\\n  wget \\\n  file \\\n  libssl-dev \\\n  libxdo-dev \\\n  libsoup-3.0-dev \\\n  libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev\n```\n\n**macOS**\n```bash\n# Install Xcode Command Line Tools\nxcode-select --install\n\n# Install additional dependencies via Homebrew (optional)\nbrew install pkg-config\n```\n\n**Windows**\n- Install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n- Install [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) (usually pre-installed on Windows 11)\n\n### Build Steps\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/getAsterisk/opcode.git\n   cd opcode\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**\n   ```bash\n   bun install\n   ```\n\n3. **Build the Application**\n   \n   **For Development (with hot reload)**\n   ```bash\n   bun run tauri dev\n   ```\n   \n   **For Production Build**\n   ```bash\n   # Build the application\n   bun run tauri build\n   \n   # The built executable will be
